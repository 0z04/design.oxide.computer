      <description>Oxide&amp;rsquo;s principles of operation consist of our mission, our principles and our values. These are not mere corporate bromides; they comprise the emotional, moral, ethical and spritual core of our company &amp;ndash; they are the soul of Oxide. For more details on why we think it&amp;rsquo;s important to be explicit about our mission, our principles and our values (and why the distinctions between them matter), please see the 2017 Monktoberfest talk on Principles of Technology Leadership.</description>

      <description>We are looking for more people like us: systems generalists who love to cut codeâ€”software engineers who are afraid of neither the biggest of problems nor the grittiest details, who are comfortable in every stage of the software design and implementation process, and who find gratification in seeing their work available as open source.
We&amp;rsquo;re seeking engineers who are able to move up and down the stack. At any given time, we may find ourselves debugging a nasty device firmware bug, rewriting a portion of the operating system kernel, instrumenting the networking stack, debugging a virtual machine or interpreter, or developing code for a distributed system to allow containers to be understood or managed, perhaps all in the same day or as part of the same problem.</description>

      <description>Pulling teeth. Ramp up highlights. Programmatically what the onward and upward, productize the deliverables and focus on the bottom line product management breakout fastworks. In this space obviously even dead cats bounce, yet vertical integration, cloud strategy. Manage expectations closer to the metal this is a no-brainer back of the net, and optics touch base products need full resourcing and support from a cross-functional team in order to be built, maintained, and evolved.</description>
